# Blog

## Description

The repo is forked from [nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit). Thanks to @[Travis Fischer](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit), I constructed my personal blog successfully even if I barely know `React` and  `TypeScript`.

The repo uses api of [Notion](https://www.notion.so), thus I can write blogs directly using Notion. I would like to share my courses notes, paper notes, reading notes and projects on [my blog](https://richardsong.space). Welcome to visit it!ü•≥
